Add Google’s Rich Snippets for reviews for a better WordPress SEO, customize search results for more traffic and conversion.

== Description ==
Add hReview and AggregateRating support based on schema.org, increase search traffic by making SERP results more eye-catching. This plugin supports only the editorial ratings submission (author rating), this means customers and site visitors are not involved in the rating process, which reflects only the author opinion. This plugin is written by [Hesham Zebida](http://zebida.com/main/), the founder of FamousBloggers.net. See live demo in full action at [Famous Bloggers](http://www.famousbloggers.net/)'s blog.

= Why You Should Implement Rich Snippets =
According to Google, rich snippets "extract and show more useful information from web pages than the preview text that you are used to seeing." Significantly, Google is using structured data open standards such as microformats and RDFa to power the rich snippets feature. It is inviting publishers to mark up their HTML and webmasters can find more details [here](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/12/rich-snippets-instructional-videos.html).

= Google's Rich Snippets Testing Tool =
After installing the plugin, and once you publish your first review on your blog, use Googl'e Rich Snippets [Testing Tool](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets) to check your markup and make sure that Google can extract the structured data from your review. This tool will display a preview of how your review might appear in Google search results.

= Spam Reporting For Google Rich Snippets =
Abusing search engines in not a good practice, especially if this can hurt others, some webmasters fake or fabricate reviews in a try to get more traffic to their sites. You can easily report them to Google. If you see any spam review fill this [form](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/request.py?hl=en&contact_type=rich_snippets_spam) to report it to Google.
