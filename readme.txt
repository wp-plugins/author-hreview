Add Google Rich Snippets for reviews based on schema.org for a better WordPress SEO, customize search results with rating stars for more traffic and conversion.

== Description ==
Add hReview and AggregateRating support based on schema.org, which help you increase search traffic by making SERP results more eye-catching. This plugin supports only the editorial ratings submission (editor/author rating), this means customers and site visitors are not involved in the rating or review process, this means rating reflects only the author's opinion. This plugin is written by [Hesham Zebida](http://zebida.com/).

= Why You Should Implement Rich Snippets =
According to Google, rich snippets "extract and show more useful information from web pages than the preview text that you are used to seeing." Significantly, Google is using structured data open standards such as microformats and RDFa to power the rich snippets feature. Google is is inviting publishers to mark up their HTML. Webmasters can find more detailed information about Google's rich snippets [here](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/12/rich-snippets-instructional-videos.html).

= Google's Rich Snippets Testing Tool =
After installing the plugin, and once you publish your first review on your blog, use Google Rich Snippets [Testing Tool](https://developers.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/) to check your markup and make sure that Google can extract the structured data from your review. The plugin should validate in the Testing Tool.

= Spam Reporting For Google Rich Snippets =
Abusing search engines in not a good practice, especially if this can hurt others, some webmasters fake or fabricate reviews in a try to get more traffic to their sites. You can easily report them to Google. If you see any spam reviews fill this [form](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/request.py?hl=en&contact_type=rich_snippets_spam) to report it to Google.
